Understand the learning behavior of natural gradient descent vs SGD and other optimization methods

## Getting Started
1. Make sure you have `npm` installed. 
2. Run `npm install -g parcel-bundler`
3. From the root folder, run `npm run ps` (short for "npm run parcel serve"). This will create a server that runs the html on a port.**
4. Open the html file that was stored in `./public`. 

** This is only needed because `parcel build` does not seem to compile the css or js correctly.
